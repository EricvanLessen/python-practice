# Description

Credit for the original version goes to Ty Shaikh at https://github.com/k2datascience/blog_analytics. 
I cloned the repo for practice reasons. 

- The code scrapes webdata from a blog and extracts particular information. 
- Analytics functions then create an analytical sumamry of those information. 
- A sketch, html, css and vanilla javascript provides a simple and clear design. 
- The barebone flask server takes the analytics knowledge from the json files and fills the vizualisation.
